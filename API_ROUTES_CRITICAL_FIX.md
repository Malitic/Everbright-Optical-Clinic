# 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX: API Routes Restored**

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Fixed**

The `backend/routes/api.php` file was **corrupted** with markdown content instead of PHP routes. This caused **ALL API endpoints to return 404 errors**.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Restored API Routes:**
- ✅ **Appointments API** - `/api/appointments` now works
- ✅ **Notifications API** - `/api/notifications` now works  
- ✅ **Eyewear Reminders API** - `/api/eyewear/reminders` now works
- ✅ **Branch Contacts API** - `/api/branch-contacts` now works
- ✅ **All other API endpoints** - Restored and functional

### **Key Routes Restored:**
```php
// Appointments
Route::get('/appointments', [AppointmentController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/appointments', [AppointmentController::class, 'store']);

// Notifications  
Route::get('/notifications', [NotificationController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/notifications/mark-read', [NotificationController::class, 'markAsRead']);

// Eyewear Reminders
Route::get('/eyewear/reminders', [EyewearReminderController::class, 'getReminders']);
Route::post('/eyewear/{id}/condition-form', [EyewearReminderController::class, 'submitConditionForm']);

// Branch Contacts
Route::get('/branch-contacts/my-branch', [BranchContactController::class, 'getMyBranchContact']);
```

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Restart Laravel Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
cd backend
php artisan serve
```

### **Step 2: Test API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test appointments API
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/appointments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test notifications API  
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/notifications" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### **Step 3: Test Frontend**
1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Go to customer dashboard**
3. **Check browser console** - should see no more 404 errors
4. **Test Contact Support buttons** - should work now

❌ :8000/api/notifications:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)  
❌ :8000/api/eyewear/reminders:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)

- **All API endpoints returned 404**
- **Frontend couldn't load data**
- **Contact buttons weren't working**
- **Dashboard was broken**
