## üß† How It Works

### Color Detection Algorithm
1. **Image Loading**: Load image into HTML5 Canvas
2. **Resize**: Optimize to 150x150 for faster processing
3. **Pixel Analysis**: Extract RGB values from each pixel
4. **Color Bucketing**: Group similar colors together
5. **Frequency Analysis**: Count occurrences of each color
6. **Palette Extraction**: Select top 5 most frequent colors
7. **Color Naming**: Map RGB values to color names using predefined ranges

### Category Detection
1. **Filename Analysis**: Parse filename for keywords
   - "sunglass" or "sun" ‚Üí Sunglasses
   - "contact" or "lens" ‚Üí Contact Lenses
   - "solution" or "care" ‚Üí Solutions
   - "frame" or "glass" ‚Üí Frames
2. **Default Fallback**: Frames (most common category)

### Brand Extraction
- Extracts first word/segment from filename
- Removes file extension
- Handles common delimiters (-, _, space)

### Confidence Scoring
- Based on color palette clarity
- Higher score = more distinct colors detected
- Typical range: 70-90% confidence

## üìä Color Detection Accuracy

### Supported Colors
- **Neutral**: Black, White, Gray, Silver
- **Warm**: Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Brown, Gold
- **Cool**: Blue, Cyan, Green, Purple

### Best Results
- **Well-lit images**: Even lighting improves accuracy
- **Solid backgrounds**: White or gray backgrounds work best
- **High resolution**: Better detail = better analysis
- **Clear focus**: Sharp images yield more accurate colors

### Limitations
- Complex patterns may be simplified
- Very similar colors may be grouped
- Transparent materials may be challenging
- Reflective surfaces can affect results

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results:
1. **Use consistent lighting** across all product photos
2. **White or neutral backgrounds** help color detection
3. **Name files descriptively**: Include brand, type, color if known
4. **Upload similar products together** for easier review
5. **Double-check AI suggestions** before exporting

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Organize photos** by product type before upload
2. **Batch similar items** (all frames, then all sunglasses, etc.)
3. **Review and adjust** AI suggestions
4. **Export results** for each batch separately
5. **Use JSON data** for bulk product creation

### Time-Saving Tips:
- AI is very accurate with categories - usually 80-90% correct
- Focus review time on color verification
- Use grid view for quick visual checks
- Use list view for fast editing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Images Not Analyzing
- **Check file format**: Must be valid image file
- **Verify file size**: Keep under 10MB per image
- **Try fewer images**: Start with 10-20 to test, then scale up
- **Clear browser cache**: Refresh and try again
- **For large batches (400+)**: Consider splitting into 2-3 batches if you experience slowness

### Incorrect Colors Detected
- **Check image quality**: Blurry images yield poor results
- **Verify lighting**: Shadows can affect color detection
- **Review background**: Busy backgrounds may confuse analysis
- **Manually adjust**: Use the edit feature to correct

### Slow Performance
- **Reduce batch size**: Try 100-200 images instead of 600
- **Close other tabs**: Free up browser memory
- **Use modern browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended
- **Check system resources**: Ensure adequate RAM available (8GB+ recommended for large batches)
- **Process in chunks**: Split 600 images into 3 batches of 200 for faster processing

### Category Always Wrong
- **Rename files**: Add keywords like "sunglass" or "frame"
- **Manually select**: Use dropdown to choose correct category
- **Set as default**: After export, use for reference
