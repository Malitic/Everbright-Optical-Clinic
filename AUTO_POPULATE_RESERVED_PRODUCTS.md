## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

#### **1. StaffCreateReceipt.tsx**
**Added:**
- `useEffect` hook to fetch reservations on component mount
- `customerId` prop to identify customer
- `Reservation` interface for type safety
- `loadReservedProducts` function
- Loading state management
- Toast notifications

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const [items, setItems] = useState([{ description: '', qty: 1, unit_price: 0, amount: 0 }]);

// After
const [items, setItems] = useState([{ description: '', qty: 1, unit_price: 0, amount: 0 }]);
const [loadingReservations, setLoadingReservations] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch and populate reserved products
}, [customerId]);
```

#### **2. App.tsx (CreateReceiptRouteWrapper)**
**Added:**
- Extract customer ID from appointment data
- Pass `customerId` to StaffCreateReceipt component

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
return <StaffCreateReceipt 
  appointmentId={id} 
  defaultCustomerName={defaultName} 
  defaultAddress={defaultAddress} 
/>;

// After
const customerId = data?.patient?.id || data?.customer_id;
return <StaffCreateReceipt 
  appointmentId={id} 
  defaultCustomerName={defaultName} 
  defaultAddress={defaultAddress} 
  customerId={customerId}  // ← NEW
/>;
```
