# Optometrist Cross-Branch Appointments Fix

## Problem
The optometrist could only see appointments from branches they were scheduled for, but since there's only one doctor, they need to see ALL appointments across ALL branches.

## Solution
Modified the backend `AppointmentController.php` to remove branch restrictions for optometrists.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php`)

#### Before:
```php
case UserRole::OPTOMETRIST->value:
    // Optometrists can see all their appointments across all branches they're scheduled for
    // Get all branches this optometrist is scheduled for
    $scheduledBranches = \App\Models\Schedule::where('optometrist_id', $user->id)
        ->where('is_active', true)
        ->pluck('branch_id')
        ->toArray();
    
    if (!empty($scheduledBranches)) {
        // If specific branch filter is requested, use it; otherwise use all scheduled branches
        if ($request->has('branch_id') && $request->branch_id !== 'all') {
            $requestedBranchId = (int) $request->branch_id;
            // Check if the requested branch is in the optometrist's scheduled branches
            if (in_array($requestedBranchId, $scheduledBranches)) {
                $query->where('branch_id', $requestedBranchId);
            } else {
                // If not authorized for this branch, return empty result
                $query->whereRaw('1 = 0');
            }
        } else {
            // Show all appointments for branches this optometrist is scheduled for
            $query->whereIn('branch_id', $scheduledBranches);
        }
        $query->whereIn('status', ['confirmed', 'scheduled', 'in_progress']); // Multiple statuses
    } else {
        // If no schedule found, return empty result
        $query->whereRaw('1 = 0');
    }
    break;
```

#### After:
```php
case UserRole::OPTOMETRIST->value:
    // Optometrists can see ALL appointments across ALL branches since there's only one doctor
    // Apply branch filter if specifically requested
    if ($request->has('branch_id') && $request->branch_id !== 'all') {
        $query->where('branch_id', $request->branch_id);
    }
    // No other restrictions - can see all appointments
    break;
```

#### Also Updated `getTodayAppointments()` method:
```php
// Before:
if (in_array($user->role->value, [UserRole::OPTOMETRIST->value, UserRole::STAFF->value])) {
    $query->where('branch_id', $user->branch_id);
}

// After:
if ($user->role->value === UserRole::STAFF->value) {
    $query->where('branch_id', $user->branch_id);
}
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (Already completed)

#### `frontend--/src/features/appointments/components/OptometristAppointments.tsx`:
- Removed `my_appointments: true` filter from `useAppointments` hook
- Updated UI text from "My Appointments" to "All Appointments"
- Added "Assigned To" column to show which optometrist each appointment is assigned to
- Enhanced action buttons for taking over appointments
- Added color coding for appointment assignment status

## Testing

### 1. Backend Test
Run the test script to verify the changes:
```bash
cd backend
php test_appointments_route.php
```

### 2. Frontend Test
1. Start the backend server: `php artisan serve`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Login as an optometrist
4. Navigate to Appointments
5. Verify you can see appointments from all branches
6. Test the branch filter to ensure it works correctly

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ What Should Work Now:
- Optometrists can see ALL appointments across ALL branches
- Branch filter still works when specifically requested
- No "empty result" messages when switching between branches
- Optometrists can take over any appointment regardless of branch
- Today's appointments show appointments from all branches

### üîí Security Maintained:
- Customer access: Still limited to their own appointments
- Staff access: Still limited to their assigned branch
- Admin access: Still can see all appointments
- Only optometrists get the expanded cross-branch access

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php` - Main backend changes
2. `frontend--/src/features/appointments/components/OptometristAppointments.tsx` - Frontend UI updates
3. `backend/test_appointments_route.php` - Test script
4. `frontend--/src/test_optometrist_cross_branch.html` - Frontend test guide

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Server Restart Required**: The backend changes require a server restart to take effect.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Check**: Ensure appointments exist in multiple branches for proper testing.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Role Verification**: Make sure the user has the 'optometrist' role in the database.

## Benefits

- Single optometrist can manage all appointments efficiently
- No need to switch between different views or accounts
- Better resource utilization for single-doctor practices
- Simplified appointment management workflow
- Clear visibility into all patient appointments across the system
