### 12. Compliance & Documentation
- [ ] Privacy policy in place
- [ ] Terms of service in place
- [ ] User data handling documented
- [ ] Audit trail accessible for compliance
- [ ] Security documentation reviewed
- [ ] Staff trained on security procedures

## üîç Security Testing

### Test 1: Authentication
```bash
# Try accessing protected route without token (should fail)
curl http://yourdomain.com/api/users

# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://yourdomain.com/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password","role":"customer"}'

# Use token (should succeed for authorized endpoints)
curl http://yourdomain.com/api/prescriptions/my \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Test 2: Authorization
```bash
# Login as customer
# Try to access admin endpoint (should return 403)
curl http://yourdomain.com/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CUSTOMER_TOKEN"
```

### Test 3: Audit Logging
```sql
-- Check that operations are being logged
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### Test 4: Soft Deletes
```bash
# Delete a record via API
curl -X DELETE http://yourdomain.com/api/prescriptions/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Check database - should have deleted_at timestamp, not actually deleted
SELECT * FROM prescriptions WHERE id = 1;
```

### Test 5: Rate Limiting
```bash
# Try login 10 times rapidly (should get rate limited)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://yourdomain.com/api/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong","role":"customer"}'
done
```

### Test 6: Backup & Restore
```bash
# Create backup
php artisan db:backup

# Test restore (on test database!)
mysql -u username -p test_database < storage/backups/backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.sql
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If breach suspected:

1. **Immediately:**
   - Change all database passwords
   - Revoke all API tokens
   - Enable maintenance mode: `php artisan down`

2. **Investigate:**
   - Check audit logs for unauthorized access
   - Review server logs
   - Identify affected data

3. **Recover:**
   - Restore from backup if necessary
   - Patch vulnerability
   - Reset affected user passwords

4. **Document:**
   - Record incident details
   - Note lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
