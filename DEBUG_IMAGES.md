# Debug: Images Not Displaying

## ‚úÖ What We Know

1. **Images ARE being saved:**
   - 29 files exist in `storage/app/public/products/`
   - Files have correct names

2. **Backend is running:**
   - Port 8000 accessible

3. **Storage folder exists:**
   - `storage/app/public/products/` exists
   - Storage link exists in `public/storage`

## üîç Testing Steps

### Test 1: Direct Image Access

**Open this URL in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/storage/products/0yv6qmf7qrCsM8AeXSF7zqEXIZfYIQBdZn4wtVaG.jpg
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Image displays ‚Üí Storage link works, problem is frontend
- ‚ùå 404 error ‚Üí Storage link broken
- ‚ùå 403 error ‚Üí Permission issue

### Test 2: Check Database Paths

Looking at what's stored in the database `image_paths` field...

### Test 3: Check Frontend Console

1. Open product gallery page
2. Press F12 (Dev Tools)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for errors
5. Go to Network tab ‚Üí Filter: Img
6. Check what URLs are being requested

## üìä Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Old Product Data

**Problem:** Products uploaded before folder existed have wrong paths

**Solution:** Delete old products and upload fresh ones

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\Product::truncate();
>>> exit
```

Then upload new products.

### Issue 2: Database Paths Wrong

**Problem:** Database stores wrong path format

**Check:** What's in database?
- ‚úÖ Correct: `["products/filename.jpg"]`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `["public/products/filename.jpg"]`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `["storage/app/public/products/filename.jpg"]`

### Issue 3: Frontend Not Using getStorageUrl()

**Problem:** Gallery component not constructing full URL

**Check:** Browser Network tab shows:
- ‚ùå Wrong: `http://localhost:5173/products/file.jpg`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `http://localhost:8000/storage/products/file.jpg`

### Issue 4: Storage Link Broken

**Problem:** `public/storage` link doesn't point correctly

**Test:** Open direct image URL (see Test 1 above)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Remove old link
Remove-Item public/storage -Force

# Create new link  
php artisan storage:link
```

## üéØ Quick Diagnostic

**Run these checks:**

1. **Direct image URL works?**
   - Open: `http://localhost:8000/storage/products/0yv6qmf7qrCsM8AeXSF7zqEXIZfYIQBdZn4wtVaG.jpg`
   - YES ‚Üí Frontend issue
   - NO ‚Üí Storage link issue

2. **Browser console errors?**
   - F12 ‚Üí Console
   - Any red errors about images?
   - What URLs are failing?

3. **Network tab shows what?**
   - F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Img filter
   - What image URLs are being requested?
   - Status codes? (200 = OK, 404 = Not Found)

## üîß Likely Fix

## üìã Information Needed

To fix this, I need to know:

1. **Does direct image URL work?**
   - Open: `http://localhost:8000/storage/products/0yv6qmf7qrCsM8AeXSF7zqEXIZfYIQBdZn4wtVaG.jpg`
   - Does image display? YES or NO?

2. **What's in browser console?**
