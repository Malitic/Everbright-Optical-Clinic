curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/eyewear/reminders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOMER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected Response:
{
  "reminders": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "eyewear_id": "456", 
      "eyewear_label": "Ray-Ban Aviator",
      "next_check_date": "2024-01-20",
      "assessment_date": "2024-01-15",
      "assessed_by": "Dr. Smith",
      "priority": "medium",
      "is_overdue": true
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

#### **Test Self-Check Form Submission:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/eyewear/456/condition-form" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOMER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

}
```

#### **Test Appointment Scheduling:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/eyewear/456/set-appointment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOMER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "appointment_date": "2024-01-25",
