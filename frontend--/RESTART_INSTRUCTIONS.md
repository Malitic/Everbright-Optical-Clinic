# 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED TO SEE UNITOP INVENTORY FIX

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must restart the frontend dev server!

The code changes I made are saved, but they won't appear until you restart the dev server.

---

## 🚀 Quick Restart Steps:

### 1. Stop Frontend Server
In the terminal running `npm run dev`:
- Press `Ctrl + C`
- Wait for it to stop

### 2. Restart Frontend Server
```bash
cd frontend--
npm run dev
```

### 3. Wait for Success Message
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### 4. Hard Refresh Browser
**Press:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

---

## 📍 Then Navigate To Correct Page:

**Go to:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory`

**NOT** `/admin/products` (that's Product Gallery - different page!)

---

## ✅ What You Should See:

### With Branch Filter = "All Branches":
You'll see inventory from ALL 4 branches (Emerald, Unitop, Newstar, Garnet)

### With Branch Filter = "Unitop Branch":  
You'll see exactly **8 items** from Unitop:
- 2 with "Low Stock" status (Glass 7)
- 6 with "In Stock" status (Glass 1-6)

### With Status Filter = "Low Stock":
You'll see ALL low stock items from ALL branches, including the 2 from Unitop

---

## 🔍 Verify in Browser Console:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. You should see:
```
AdminCentralInventory: Loading with filters: {...}
AdminCentralInventory: Loaded X items
AdminCentralInventory: Unitop items: 8
```

If you see `Unitop items: 8` - it's working! ✅

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Use the Test Page

I created a test endpoint to verify data:

**Open in browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/api/test-unitop-inventory
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "total_items": 8,
  "low_stock_count": 2,
  "items": [
    {"product": "Glass 7", "stock": 3, "is_low_stock": true, ...},
    {"product": "Glass 7", "stock": 5, "is_low_stock": true, ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

This confirms the backend has the data! ✅
