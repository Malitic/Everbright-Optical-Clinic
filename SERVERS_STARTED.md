# ✅ Servers Started Successfully!

## 🎉 Both Servers Are Now Running

### Backend (Laravel API)
- ✅ **Status**: Running
- 🌐 **URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- 📡 **API**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
- 💾 **Database**: Connected

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- ✅ **Status**: Running  
- 🌐 **URL**: http://localhost:5173
- 📱 **Also accessible on network**: Check the PowerShell window for the network URL (usually http://192.168.x.x:5173)

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Open Your Browser

**Option A: Local Access**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

**Option B: Network Access**
```
Check the frontend PowerShell window - it shows something like:
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://192.168.100.6:5173/

Use the Network URL if you're accessing from another device
```

### 2. Login

Use your admin credentials:
```
Email: admin@optical.test
Password: admin123
```

### 3. Navigate to Inventory Views

After logging in, check these views:

**A. Multi-branch Inventory**
```
Navigation: Dashboard → Inventory → Multi-branch Inventory
Or directly: http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory/consolidated
```

**B. Product Gallery Management**
```
Navigation: Dashboard → Products → Product Gallery
Or directly: http://localhost:5173/admin/products
```

**C. Inventory Management**
```
Navigation: Dashboard → Inventory
Or directly: http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory
```

### 4. Filter by Unitop Branch

Once in any inventory view:
1. Look for "Branch" dropdown or filter
2. Select "Unitop Branch" or "UNITOP"
3. You should now see **8 products** including:
   - **Glass 7 (4 units) - Low Stock** ← This is your low stock item!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't connect to backend"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Backend server PowerShell window is still open and running
2. ✅ No error messages in the backend window
3. ✅ Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in browser - should show Laravel page

**Fix:**
- If backend crashed, restart it:
  ```powershell
  cd C:\Users\prota\thesis_test1\backend
  php artisan serve
  ```

### Issue: "Frontend page won't load"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Frontend server PowerShell window is still open and running
2. ✅ No error messages (red text) in frontend window
3. ✅ Port 5173 is shown as listening

**Fix:**
- If frontend crashed, restart it:
  ```powershell
  cd C:\Users\prota\thesis_test1\frontend--
  npm run dev
  ```

### Issue: "Login fails"

**Check:**
1. ✅ You're using the correct credentials (admin@optical.test / admin123)
2. ✅ Backend is running (see above)
3. ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Fix:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for network errors
- If you see CORS errors, make sure you're accessing via the correct URL

### Issue: "Still don't see Unitop products"

**Check:**
1. ✅ You're logged in as **admin** (not customer or staff)
2. ✅ You've selected the right view (Multi-branch Inventory or Product Gallery)
3. ✅ Branch filter is set to "Unitop" or "All"
4. ✅ You've refreshed the page (F5) after servers started

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify auth token is stored (F12 → Application → Session Storage → look for 'auth_token')

## 📊 Expected Results

After following the steps above, you should see:

### In Multi-branch Inventory:
```
Branch: Unitop Branch (UNITOP)
Total Products: 8

Products:
1. Glass 1 - 25 units (In Stock)
2. Glass 2 - 25 units (In Stock)
3. Glass 3 - 25 units (In Stock)
4. Glass 4 - 25 units (In Stock) [Pending Approval]
5. Glass 5 - 25 units (In Stock) [Pending Approval]
6. Glass 6 - 25 units (In Stock) [Pending Approval]
7. Glass 7 - 10 units (In Stock) [Pending Approval]
8. Glass 7 - 4 units (🔴 Low Stock) ← YOUR ITEM!
```

### In Product Gallery:
```
Each Glass product should show:
- Product details
- Branch availability section
- Unitop Branch: X units available
```

### In Inventory Dashboard:
```
Branch dropdown should include "Unitop Branch"
Selecting it shows all 8 products
Low stock alert should highlight Glass 7 (4 units)
```

## 🔥 Quick Test

To verify everything is working:

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Login**: admin@optical.test / admin123
3. **Open console**: Press F12
4. **Navigate**: Go to any inventory page
5. **Check console**: Should see successful API calls like:
   ```
   GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/branch-inventory 200 OK
   GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/branches 200 OK
   ```
6. **Look for data**: Unitop products should be visible

## 📝 What the Fix Did

### Database Changes:
- ✅ Applied migration to consolidate inventory

- ✅ Synced stock quantities between tables
- ✅ All products now active and linked properly

### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ Added auto-refresh (30 seconds) to all admin views
- ✅ API calls now return Unitop data correctly
- ✅ Branch filters include Unitop

### Backend Changes:
- ✅ Sync mechanism working (staff updates → admin sees changes)
- ✅ All API endpoints return Unitop inventory
- ✅ Low stock alerts triggering correctly

## 🎯 Server Management

### To Stop Servers:
- Go to each PowerShell window
- Press `Ctrl+C`
- Type `Y` if asked to confirm

### To Start Servers (if stopped):

**Backend:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\prota\thesis_test1\backend
php artisan serve
```

**Frontend:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\prota\thesis_test1\frontend--
npm run dev
```

### Using the Batch File:
You also have a convenience script:
```powershell
.\start_servers.bat
```

This starts both servers automatically.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep PowerShell windows open** - Don't close them while using the app
2. **Watch for errors** - Red text in PowerShell = something went wrong
3. **Use F12 console** - Helps debug any frontend issues
4. **Use F5** - Refreshes data immediately (don't wait 30s)
5. **Check Network tab** - Shows if API calls are succeeding

---

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check both PowerShell windows** - Make sure no errors
2. **Restart servers** - Stop (Ctrl+C) and start again
3. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+Shift+Delete
4. **Check browser console** - F12 for error messages
5. **Verify database** - Check phpMyAdmin for data

**The system is ready! Open your browser and check the inventory views!** 🚀
