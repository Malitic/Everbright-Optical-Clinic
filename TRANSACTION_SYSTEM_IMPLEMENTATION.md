# Unified Transaction Management System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive transaction management system has been implemented for the Optical Management System that unifies appointments, product reservations, and receipts into a single transaction-based structure.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Structure
- **Transactions Table**: Created with the following structure:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `transaction_code` (Unique, auto-generated)
  - `customer_id` (Foreign Key to users)
  - `branch_id` (Foreign Key to branches)
  - `appointment_id` (Nullable Foreign Key to appointments)
  - `reservation_id` (Nullable Foreign Key to reservations)
  - `total_amount` (Decimal)
  - `status` (Enum: Pending, Completed, Cancelled)
  - `payment_method` (Enum: Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Online Payment)
  - `notes` (Text, nullable)
  - `completed_at` (Timestamp, nullable)
  - `timestamps`

### 2. Models and Relationships

#### Transaction Model (`app/Models/Transaction.php`)
- **Auto-generated transaction codes**: Format `TXN-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`
- **Relationships**:
  - `customer()`: BelongsTo User
  - `branch()`: BelongsTo Branch
  - `appointment()`: BelongsTo Appointment
  - `reservation()`: BelongsTo Reservation
  - `receipt()`: HasOne Receipt
- **Status Management**:
  - `isPending()`, `isCompleted()`, `isCancelled()`
  - `markAsCompleted()`, `markAsCancelled()`
- **Scopes**:
  - `pending()`, `completed()`, `cancelled()`
  - `forBranch()`, `forCustomer()`, `byDateRange()`

#### Updated Existing Models
- **Appointment Model**: Added `transaction()` relationship
- **Reservation Model**: Added `transaction()` relationship
- **User Model**: Added `transactions()` relationship
- **Branch Model**: Added `transactions()` relationship

### 3. API Endpoints

#### TransactionController (`app/Http/Controllers/TransactionController.php`)
- **GET** `/api/transactions` - List all transactions (staff/admin)
- **POST** `/api/transactions` - Create new transaction
- **GET** `/api/transactions/{id}` - Get transaction details
- **POST** `/api/transactions/{id}/finalize` - Finalize transaction
- **GET** `/api/transactions/{id}/receipt/download` - Download receipt PDF
- **GET** `/api/customer/transactions` - Customer transaction history
- **GET** `/api/admin/transactions/analytics` - Admin analytics

### 4. Key Features

#### Transaction Creation
- Automatic transaction code generation
- Links appointments and reservations
- Calculates total amounts

- **Features**:
  - Global transaction overview
  - Revenue analytics by branch
  - Payment method breakdowns
  - Completion rate tracking
- **Capabilities**:
  - Date range filtering
  - Branch-specific analytics
  - Export capabilities

#### Customer Transaction History (`src/components/transactions/CustomerTransactionHistory.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Personal transaction history
  - Receipt download
  - Transaction status tracking
  - Spending summaries
- **Capabilities**:
  - Filter by status and date
  - View transaction details
  - Download receipts

#### Transaction Dashboard (`src/components/transactions/TransactionDashboard.tsx`)
- **Role-based Interface**:
  - Admin: Analytics + Management tabs
  - Staff/Optometrist: Transaction management
  - Customer: Transaction history
- **Features**:
  - Quick stats overview
  - Recent transaction notifications
  - Role-appropriate functionality

#### Transaction Notifications (`src/components/transactions/TransactionNotification.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time transaction updates
  - Status change notifications
  - Receipt download links
  - Transaction summaries

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Appointment/Reservation Confirmation
When appointments or reservations are confirmed:
1. Create new transaction record
2. Link appointment/reservation IDs
3. Calculate total amount
4. Set status to "Pending"

### 2. Transaction Finalization
When services are completed:
1. Staff finalizes transaction
2. System generates receipt
3. Updates stock quantities
4. Sends notifications
5. Marks as "Completed"

### 3. Notification System
- **Customer**: Receipt ready notification
- **Staff**: Transaction completion confirmation
- **Admin**: System-wide transaction updates

## Benefits

### 1. Unified Tracking
- Single source of truth for all transactions
- Links appointments, reservations, and receipts
- Easy to track customer journey

### 2. Improved Reporting
