# Admin Central Inventory & Product Gallery Stock Sync Fix

## Overview
Fixed the synchronization between staff inventory, admin central inventory, and product gallery to properly display real-time stock quantities across all systems.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Product Gallery Not Showing Stocks**
- ❌ Products showed no stock information
- ❌ Stock status not calculated from branch_stocks table
- ❌ Total stock across branches not displayed

### 2. **Admin Central Inventory Missing Data**
- ❌ Stock quantities not synchronized from branch_stocks
- ❌ No total stock visibility across all branches
- ❌ Reserved quantities not displayed

### 3. **Product API Missing Stock Calculations**
- ❌ API only returned branch availability, not totals
- ❌ No aggregated stock data for admin overview

## Solutions Implemented

### Backend Changes (ProductController.php)

#### **Product API Enhancement** (Lines 61-95)
Added comprehensive stock calculations to product API response:

```php
// Calculate total stock across all branches
$totalStock = $branchAvailability->sum('stock_quantity');
$totalReserved = $branchAvailability->sum('reserved_quantity');
$totalAvailable = $totalStock - $totalReserved;

$product->total_stock = $totalStock;
$product->total_reserved = $totalReserved;
$product->total_available = $totalAvailable;
$product->stock_status = $totalAvailable > 0 ? 'in_stock' : 'out_of_stock';
$product->branches_count = $branchAvailability->count();
```

**Enhanced Branch Availability Data:**
- ✅ `stock_id`: ID of branch stock entry
- ✅ `branch_id`: Branch identifier
- ✅ `stock_quantity`: Total stock at branch
- ✅ `reserved_quantity`: Reserved stock at branch
- ✅ `available_quantity`: Available for customers
- ✅ `min_stock_threshold`: Restock threshold
- ✅ `status`: Stock status per branch
- ✅ `is_available`: Boolean availability flag

**New Aggregate Fields:**
- ✅ `total_stock`: Sum of stock across ALL branches
- ✅ `total_reserved`: Sum of reserved across ALL branches  
- ✅ `total_available`: Total available for purchase
- ✅ `stock_status`: Overall stock status (in_stock/out_of_stock)
- ✅ `branches_count`: Number of branches with this product

### Frontend Changes

#### **AdminProductManagement.tsx - New Total Stock Column** (Lines 379-381, 431-448)
Added dedicated column to display comprehensive stock information:

**Display Format:**
```
Total Stock Column:
├─ 📦 125 (total stock quantity)
├─ Available: 98 (available for customers)
└─ Reserved: 27 (if any reservations)
```

**Features:**
- Shows total stock across all branches
- Displays available quantity (stock - reserved)
- Highlights reserved quantities in orange if > 0
- Updates automatically every 30 seconds

#### **AdminProductManagement.tsx - Branch Availability Column** (Lines 382-384, 449-459)
Enhanced to show clear branch distribution:

**Display Format:**
```
🏢 5/7 branches
(5 branches have available stock out of 7 total branches)
```

#### **AdminCentralInventory.tsx - Enhanced Stock Display** (Lines 446-475)
Added detailed stock information for each inventory item:

**Display Format:**
```
📦 125 units (stock quantity)
Reserved: 27 (if any, shown in orange)
Available: 98 (shown in green)
⚠️ Min: 5 (threshold)
```

**Features:**
- Shows total stock quantity per branch in bold
- Displays reserved quantity (orange) if > 0
- Displays available quantity (green) for clarity
- Shows minimum stock threshold
- Includes price override if set
- Shows expiry date if applicable

## How Stock Synchronization Works

### Data Flow:
```
Staff Adds/Updates Inventory
        ↓
BranchStock Table Updated
        ↓
Product API Aggregates Stock from ALL Branches
        ↓
Frontend Auto-Refreshes (30s interval)
        ↓
Admin Sees Updated Totals in:
  ├─ Central Inventory
  ├─ Product Gallery Management
  └─ Branch Stock Modal
```

### Stock Calculation Logic:

**Per Product:**
1. Query all `branch_stocks` entries for product
2. Sum `stock_quantity` across branches = **Total Stock**
3. Sum `reserved_quantity` across branches = **Total Reserved**
4. Calculate `total_available` = Total Stock - Total Reserved
5. Determine `stock_status`:
   - `in_stock` if total_available > 0
   - `out_of_stock` if total_available = 0

**Example:**
```
Product: Ray-Ban Aviator

Branch Stocks:
├─ Main Branch: 50 stock, 10 reserved → 40 available
├─ Unitop Branch: 30 stock, 5 reserved → 25 available
├─ Downtown: 45 stock, 12 reserved → 33 available
└─ East Branch: 0 stock, 0 reserved → 0 available

Totals:
├─ Total Stock: 125
├─ Total Reserved: 27
├─ Total Available: 98
├─ Stock Status: in_stock
└─ Branches: 4/4 (3 have available stock)
```
