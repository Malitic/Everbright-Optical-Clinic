### 🎯 How to See Staff Updates:

**Option 1: Wait 30 seconds** (Auto-refresh)

- No action needed

**Option 2: Manual Refresh** (Instant)
- Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R`

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Database Sync:
```sql
-- Verify products total = sum of branch stocks
SELECT 
    p.name,
    p.stock_quantity as total,
    SUM(bs.stock_quantity) as branch_sum
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN branch_stock bs ON p.id = bs.product_id
GROUP BY p.id;
```

**Expected**: `total` column = `branch_sum` column

### Check Migration:
```bash
cd backend
php artisan migrate:status | Select-String "consolidate"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Admin doesn't see my changes"

**Solution 1**: Wait 30 seconds (auto-refresh is working)  
**Solution 2**: Press `F5` to force refresh  
**Solution 3**: Clear browser cache (`Ctrl+Shift+Delete`)

### "Changes not saving"

**Check 1**: See success message after clicking "Update"?  
**Check 2**: Check browser console (F12) for errors  
**Check 3**: Check Laravel logs: `backend/storage/logs/laravel.log`

### "Stock numbers don't match"

**Understand**:
- Admin sees TOTAL (sum of all branches)
- Staff sees ONLY their branch
- Click "Manage Stock" in admin to see per-branch breakdown

## 📝 Key Points

### Data Flow:
```
staff_update() 
  → branch_stock table updated
  → syncProductStockQuantity()
  → products table updated
  → admin_refresh()
  → admin sees update
```

### Timing:
- **Staff → Database**: Instant ✅
- **Database → Products Table**: Instant ✅  
- **Products Table → Admin UI**: 30 seconds or F5 ✅

### Safety:
- ✅ All updates are transactional (no data loss)
- ✅ Foreign keys enforced
- ✅ Timestamps track all changes
- ✅ Staff can't affect other branches

## 📞 Quick Help

### Staff Issue:
"I updated stock but it's not saved"

### Admin Issue:
"I don't see staff updates"
