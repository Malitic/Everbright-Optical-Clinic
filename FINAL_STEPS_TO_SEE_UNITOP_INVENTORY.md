# ✅ FINAL STEPS - See Unitop Low Stock Items

## 🎯 Backend is VERIFIED WORKING ✅

The API confirms:
- **8 total items** in Unitop branch
- **2 low stock items** (Glass 7: stock 3 and 5)
- Data is in the database correctly

---

## 🔧 What I Just Fixed:

### Fixed in `AdminCentralInventory.tsx`:

1. **Status Comparison** - Now handles both formats:
   - "Low Stock" (from backend)
   - "low_stock" (normalized)

2. **Branch ID Comparison** - Ensures string comparison:
   - Backend returns: `"2"` or `2`
   - Now compares both as strings

3. **Debug Logging** - Added detailed console logs to track every filter check

---

## 🚀 ACTION REQUIRED - Follow These 3 Steps:

### Step 1: Restart Frontend Dev Server ⚡

**In your terminal running the frontend:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server

# Then restart:
cd frontend--
npm run dev
```

**Wait for this message:**
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Your Browser 🔄

**Press:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**OR:** 
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

---

### Step 3: Navigate to Admin Inventory 📍

**URL:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory`

**Make sure you're NOT on:**
- ❌ `/admin/products` (Product Gallery - different page!)
- ❌ `/admin/inventory/consolidated`
- ❌ `/admin/stock-management`

---

## 📊 What You'll See:

### With Filters Set to "All":

**Branch:** All Branches  
**Status:** All

You'll see inventory from ALL 4 branches including:
- Emerald items
- **Unitop items (8 total)** ← These should now appear!
- Newstar items
- Garnet items

### Filter to Just Unitop:

**Branch:** Unitop Branch  
**Status:** All

You'll see exactly **8 items**:
```
Product   | Stock | Status
----------|-------|-------------
Glass 7   | 3     | ⚠️ Low Stock
Glass 7   | 5     | ⚠️ Low Stock
Glass 1   | 25    | ✓ In Stock
Glass 2   | 25    | ✓ In Stock
Glass 3   | 25    | ✓ In Stock
Glass 4   | 25    | ✓ In Stock
Glass 5   | 24    | ✓ In Stock
Glass 6   | 24    | ✓ In Stock
```

### Filter to Just Low Stock:

**Branch:** All Branches  
**Status:** Low Stock

You'll see all low stock items from ALL branches, including the 2 from Unitop.

---

## 🔍 Check Browser Console (F12):

You should see detailed logs like:

```javascript
AdminCentralInventory: Loading with filters: {
  searchTerm: "",
  statusFilter: "all",
  branchFilter: "all",
  manufacturerFilter: "all"
}

AdminCentralInventory: Loaded 32 items
AdminCentralInventory: Unitop items: 8

Filter check: {
  product: "Glass 7",
  branch: "2",
  status: "Low Stock",
  matchesSearch: true,
  matchesStatus: true,
  matchesBranch: true,
  matchesManufacturer: true
}
```

**If you see these logs** → The component is working! ✅

---

## 🧪 Quick Test Before Restarting Frontend:

**Open this URL in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/api/test-unitop-inventory
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "total_items": 8,
  "low_stock_count": 2,
  "items": [...]
}
```

This confirms backend is ready! ✅

---

## ❓ If Still Not Showing After Restart:

### 1. Check Which Page You're On:
**Correct:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory`  
**Incorrect:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/products`

### 2. Check Filter Dropdowns:
Make sure they're set to "All Branches" and "All Status"

### 3. Check Browser Console:
Look for the debug logs I added. If you don't see them, the old code is still cached.

### 4. Clear Browser Data:
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
sessionStorage.clear();
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### 5. Check if New Code is Running:
In console, if you see:
```
AdminCentralInventory: Loading with filters: ...
Filter check: ...
```
The new code is running! ✅

If you DON'T see these logs, restart the dev server again.

## 📸 What to Check:

Please verify you see:

1. **✅ URL:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/inventory`
2. **✅ Page Title:** Should say "Inventory Management" or similar

4. **✅ Table:** Showing products with columns: Name, SKU, Branch, Quantity, Status
5. **✅ Console Logs:** Debug messages in browser console
6. **✅ Unitop Items:** 8 items when filtered to Unitop branch

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

✅ 2 rows show "Low Stock" status  
✅ Filters work and reload data automatically
