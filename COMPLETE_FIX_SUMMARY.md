## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "I still don't see Unitop products"

**Try these in order:**
1. ✅ Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (clears cache)
2. ✅ Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
3. ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. ✅ Verify you're logged in as admin (not customer)
5. ✅ Check if "Pending" filter is hiding 4 products

### "Low stock item not showing"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Filter by branch = "Unitop"
2. ✅ Filter by status = "Low Stock" or "All"
3. ✅ Look for "Glass 7" with 4 units
4. ✅ Refresh page (F5)

### "Stock numbers don't match"

**Remember:**
- Admin sees TOTAL stock (sum of all branches)
- Staff sees ONLY their branch stock
- "Manage Stock" button shows per-branch breakdown
- This is correct behavior!

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### Data Flow:
```
STAFF UPDATE
    ↓ (instant)
branch_stock TABLE UPDATED
    ↓ (automatic)
products.stock_quantity SYNCED
    ↓ (30 seconds or F5)
ADMIN VIEWS REFRESHED
    ↓
ADMIN SEES UPDATE
```

### Key Tables:
- **`branch_stock`**: Source of truth for each branch's inventory
- **`products`**: Stores product details and total stock (sum of branches)
- **`branches`**: Branch information (Main, Unitop, etc.)

### Key Fields:
- **`branch_id`**: Links product to branch (NOW FIXED for Unitop)
- **`is_active`**: Controls visibility (all Unitop products are active)
- **`approval_status`**: Controls customer visibility (admin sees all)
- **`stock_quantity`**: Current stock level
- **`status`**: In Stock / Low Stock / Out of Stock
