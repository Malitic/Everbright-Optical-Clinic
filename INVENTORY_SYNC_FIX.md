# Inventory Synchronization Fix

## Problem
Staff inventory items were not syncing properly with Admin inventory and Product Gallery because:
1. Products were created without price field
2. Brand and model fields weren't being saved
3. Image paths were saved incorrectly (singular vs array)
4. Products weren't auto-approved for the gallery

## Solution

### Backend Changes (EnhancedInventoryController.php)

#### 1. **Create Method (store)** - Lines 242-293
**Fixed:**
- Now properly creates products with ALL required fields for gallery visibility:
  - `price`: Set from `unit_price` parameter
  - `brand` and `model`: Saved for searchability
  - `image_paths`: Stored as array (not singular)
  - `primary_image`: Set for gallery display
  - `approval_status`: Auto-set to 'approved' for staff products
  - `created_by` and `created_by_role`: Track who added it

**Smart Update Logic:**
- If product already exists (same SKU), it updates missing fields:
  - Adds price if product has none
  - Adds brand/model if missing
  - Adds images if none exist

#### 2. **Update Method** - Lines 388-430
**Fixed:**
- Updates Product table when staff edits inventory
- Syncs changes to:
  - Product name
  - Description
  - Brand and model
  - Images (as array)
  - Base price
- Changes reflect in both Admin inventory AND Product Gallery

### Frontend Changes (UnifiedStaffInventory.tsx)

#### 1. **Add Product API Call** - Lines 155-170
**Fixed:**
- Changed field names to match backend expectations:
  - `name` → `product_name`
  - `price` → `unit_price`
  - `stock_quantity` → `quantity`
  - `min_stock_threshold` → `min_threshold`
- Added `brand` and `model` fields

#### 2. **Update Stock API Call** - Lines 191-206
**Fixed:**
- Updated payload to use correct field names:
  - `stock_quantity` → `quantity`
  - `min_stock_threshold` → `min_threshold`
  - `price_override` → `unit_price`
- Added `brand` and `model` to update payload

## How It Works Now

### When Staff Adds Inventory:
1. **Product Table**: Creates/updates product with full details
   - Price, brand, model, images all saved
   - Status set to 'approved' automatically
   - Visible in Product Gallery immediately
   
2. **BranchStock Table**: Creates branch-specific stock record
   - Quantity, min threshold, expiry date
   - Price override (if different from base price)
   - Visible in both Staff and Admin inventory

### When Staff Updates Inventory:
1. **Product Table**: Updates if name, description, brand, model, or images change
   - Changes reflect across all branches viewing that product
   
2. **BranchStock Table**: Updates stock levels for that branch only
   - Changes visible in Admin inventory instantly
   - Auto-refresh keeps data current (30-second interval)

### When Staff Deletes Inventory:
1. **BranchStock Table**: Only deletes the branch stock record
2. **Product Table**: Product remains (may be used by other branches)
3. **Product Gallery**: Product still visible if other branches have stock

## Verification Steps

### Test 1: Add New Product
1. Login as Staff
2. Go to Branch Inventory
3. Add new product with all fields
4. **Expected**: Product appears in:
   - Staff Inventory ✅
   - Admin Inventory (within 30 seconds) ✅
   - Product Gallery (immediately) ✅

### Test 2: Update Product
1. Edit existing inventory item
2. Change name, price, brand
3. **Expected**: Changes appear in:
   - Staff Inventory ✅
   - Admin Inventory ✅
   - Product Gallery ✅

### Test 3: Check Synchronization
1. Admin views inventory
2. Should see same data as staff added
3. Product Gallery shows same products
4. All pricing and details match

## Benefits

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Products table is master, synced everywhere
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Admin sees staff changes within 30 seconds
✅ **Immediate Gallery Visibility**: Customers see new products instantly
✅ **Data Consistency**: Same product info across all views
✅ **Multi-Branch Support**: Product shared, stock levels separate
✅ **Auto-Approval**: No manual approval needed for staff products
